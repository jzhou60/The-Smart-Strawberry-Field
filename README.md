# The Smart Strawberry Field Data Visualization

While many crops already are or are becoming mechanized, many valuable  crops still are hand-picked.    These crops sometimes need new ways to collect precise geospatial harvest data which can then be used to monitor, measure, and optimize what is happening in the field.

This is the research project I conducted with Prof. Richard Sowers in UIUC.
